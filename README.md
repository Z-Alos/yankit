# Yankit  
_Yank videos from YouTube like you *own* the platform._  
Just paste the YouTube link, smash the button, and 💣 **Boom!**

And yep, it can autostart on boot — so you're always in beast mode without lifting a finger.

## 🚀 Installation

### 🪟 Windows  
- Head over to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Z-Alos/yankit/releases) section.  
- Download the `.exe` file.  
- Run the installer (as if I needed to say it... but hey 😆).

### 🐧 Linux  
- Same drill, go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/Z-Alos/yankit/releases).  
- Download the `.AppImage`.  
- Give it superpowers and run:

```bash
chmod +x Yankit.AppImage
./Yankit.AppImage
```

## 🧩 Make Downloading Effortless — With the Browser Extension

Take your Yankit experience to the next level with the **official browser extension** 👉 [**Yankit Extension**](https://github.com/Z-Alos/youtube-video-dowloader)

### 🔗 Somethings to keep in mind   
The extension still needs the **Yankit app** running in the background to handle downloading.  

So don't forget to **install and run the app**, or the extension will just be sitting there, looking cute and doing nothing 😅.
